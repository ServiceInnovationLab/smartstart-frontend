We do not use, share or transfer personal information in connection with the site except as set out in this policy, or as otherwise set out somewhere on the site. This privacy statement applies to personal information collected through the SmartStart website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smartstart.services.govt.nz/\">https://SmartStart.services.govt.nz</a></p>\n<h3>Collection, storage and use</h3>\n<h4>No need to disclose personal information</h4>\n<p>You can use the website without disclosing your personal information. If you choose not to provide personal information to the website the information you access from the website will be generic.</p>\n<h4>Collection of personal information</h4>\n<p>The website provides information about services associated with the birth of a child. The site is operated by the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) with links to other agencies involved in the services, including Inland Revenue, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social Development.</p>\n<p>Where you voluntarily choose to provide personal information we can develop a customer profile and provide information that is more relevant to your situation. This information may be viewable by site administrators, DIA staff (as appropriate) and third-party contractors who may administrate or work on the site. Third party contractors are subject to the DIA&rsquo;s information security and privacy requirements.</p>\n<p>The personal information that you provide is protected by your RealMe login.</p>\n<h4>Storage of personal information</h4>\n<p>When you provide personal information, it will be held by DIA. We will store and keep your personal information secure in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993.</p>\n<p>The Department takes information security seriously. Our systems, including any information you provide through the website and by other methods is monitored for security purposes.&nbsp;This may include monitoring and access by third parties that provide services to DIA. This monitoring ensures that your information and DIA&rsquo;s information and systems are kept safe.</p>\n<h4>Use of personal information</h4>\n<p>DIA will generally only use personal information provided to us through this website for the purpose you provided it (e.g. to administer, evaluate and improve the website, to improve our services, or to action or respond to the information provided).</p>\n<p>We will only use personal information provided to us through this website for other reasons permitted under the Privacy Act 1993 (e.g. with your consent, for a directly related purpose, or where the law permits or requires it).</p>\n<p>If your device uses location services to provide your address or location, in order to access a list of locally available services, you need to know we use a Google Maps service to filter service options. Use of Google Maps is subject to Google&rsquo;s privacy policy (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/\">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>) and the Google Maps Terms of Service (<a href=\"http://developers.google.com/maps/terms\">http://developers.google.com/maps/terms</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Submission of personal information in registering your baby</h4>\n<p>Information regarding the registration of your child&rsquo;s birth is collected under the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Act 1995 ('the Act'). Both parents are primarily responsible for notifying the birth as soon as practicable. It is an offence, punishable by a fine, to fail or refuse to provide information for the registration of a birth.</p>\n<p>The citizenship or immigration details of the parent(s) of a child born on or after 1 January 2006 will be checked against databases held by the Department of Internal Affairs (Citizenship Office, Passports Office or Births, Deaths and Marriages), the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Immigration) and / or with registration authorities in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau (where relevant). The information will be used to confirm whether your child is a New Zealand citizen by birth.</p>\n<h4>Saving and deletion of information in registering your baby</h4>\n<p>You may use your RealMe login to save a partially completed birth registration. This allows you to log in at a later time to complete a birth registration. The information you provide will be deleted after it has been submitted to the Department of Internal Affairs. Partially completed forms that have not been submitted will be automatically deleted after one year.</p>\n<h4>Sharing of information in registering your baby</h4>\n<p>If you decide to also apply for an IRD number for your child when registering your baby, Births, Deaths, and Marriages will give the information you have provided on this form to Inland Revenue for this purpose. After giving the information to Inland Revenue, Births, Deaths and Marriages will not retain details of your IRD number if you have provided it on this form.</p>\n<p>If you have decided to notify the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) of your child&rsquo;s birth, Births, Deaths and Marriages will provide MSD with information about the birth when the registration is complete. MSD will use this information to determine how your new baby changes the benefits and services you are entitled to.<br /> After giving the information to MSD, Births Deaths and Marriages will not retain details of your MSD client number if you provided it on this form.</p>\n<h4>Birth information records held by the Department of Internal Affairs</h4>\n<p>The birth information submitted to Births Deaths and Marriages will be held on a public register. The Act governs access to registered birth information. Information about a named individual may generally be accessed by any person upon application (e.g. as a certificate or printout). Information may be released for statistical, or genuine health or demographic research in the public interest, or to certain government agencies, as authorised by law. Information about why the information is collected, the government agencies that are authorised to receive the information, and about a person's right to access and, where appropriate, correct the information, is available on our web site&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bdm.govt.nz/\" target=\"_blank\">www.bdm.govt.nz</a>, or Freephone 0800 22 52 52.</p>\n<h3>Statistical information and cookies</h3>\n<h4>Statistical information collected</h4>\n<p>We may collect statistical information about your visit to help us improve the Site.
