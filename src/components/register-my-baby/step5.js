            The easiest way to apply for an IRD number is using this birth registration form. It is free to apply for an IRD number and it saves you having to get another set of forms to apply for it later. If you apply for one now, you should receive it within 15 working days of submitting a correct and complete birth registration form. The IRD number will arrive separately to the birth certificate (if you're ordering one).
